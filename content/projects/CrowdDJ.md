Inspired by the assessment used by MoneyLion, I created a decision tree classifier that takes in a variety of customer details, including personal, financial, and employment information, to determine their eligibility for a loan.

By training the model on a dataset of previously approved and rejected loan applications, I was able to identify the most important factors that influence loan approval and predict whether an applicant would be approved or rejected, with an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 0.86.

This model has the potential to save lenders a significant amount of time and resources, by automating the decision-making process for loan applications, reducing the need for manual reviews and minimizing the risk of human error.
